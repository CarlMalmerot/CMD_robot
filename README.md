This repository contains all code that was used in our Collinear Mecanum Drive robot created for our bachelors thesis at KTH.

The source code running on the robot can be found under CMD_robot/CMD_Stabilizing_Robot_Main/src.
No external libraries were used for the robot, so all necessary files are found in the src folder.

In the same way, the hand controller code can be found under Hand_Controller_DevKitCV4/src
